### Flaps

Flask and maps.

A toy app designed to be run locally in order to preview .gpx traces on maps background. Maps are handled through [Openlayers](http://openlayers.org/)

Just pick a .gpx file and it will display your gps trace on a background map. The .gpx files have to be in the static folder of the Flaps app.

You can choose between aerial or road maps. The map will automatically center itself on the trace area.

To use it clone the repo, and install dependencies by running ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Once done just visit ```localhost:5000```
